In order to use our AI calculator, you need to install the pandas and sklearn libraries. The python file caiculatorPyscript.py contains a function that takes a simple string expression, i.e. "5*2" and will return what the AI thinks the right answer is, i.e. 14.35. 

Also contained in this repo, we have a working and stylish calculator app which allows for the user to see the true answer to their expressions.
